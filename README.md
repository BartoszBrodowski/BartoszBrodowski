## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Bartosz Brodowski, I'm a Computer Science student at the University of GdaÅ„sk in Poland.
I'm currently studying React.js and React Native. 

### What are my current interests? :yo_yo:

Most probably front-end/design stuff like creating web apps etc. Im really keen on JS and CSS,
which also made me want to pick up React.

### Tools and technologies :hammer_and_wrench:

*yet to be added*
